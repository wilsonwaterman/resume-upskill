# About this Repo
Hi, my name is Wilson and I am a DevOps Engineer. I started this site as a profile to help showcase my indepedent work.

As someone who's interests lie mostly in DevOps and Cloud Engineering, I want to emphasize aspects such as CICD, efficient use of AWS, and system automation. I hope to continue to build my profile with that in mind.

The goal of this project is to be the home of my technical profile. Today, my site is simply my resume. It will grow to include the following aspects
- CICD configuration, using Github Actions
- Terraform Templates
- Code to incorporate the tracking of site statistics
- Links to future, larger scale personal projects
